								<h3>Project Description</h3>
								<p>For this project we should create a website with the purpose of documenting the projects in this course. The website should also include information about yourself and your resume. It should be created by using HTML and then uploaded to GitHub using Git Bash.</p>

									<h3>Preface</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Prior to the making of this website I had little previous experience with web page development and no experiance with HTML. I wanted to make a website I could use sometime in the future as a portfolio for my work and projects. Therefor, I created this webpage for that purpose and aswell to document my work for the course Manufacturing Processes I am attending this semester.</p>

									<h3>Creating the website and its repository</h3>
									<h4>1. Preperation</h4>
								</header>
								<p>First, because of my lack of knowledge of the matter of creating a website using HTML, I began by quickly scrolling through the HTML tutorial on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools.com/html</a>. Again, because of lack of knowledge and because of convenience, I decided to use a templete for my website. As recommended by Hafliði I searched for a suitable templete at <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up.net</a>. I choose the templete "Landed" because of its simple and clean style, which I felt was well suited for my purpose.</p>
                                
                                <img src="images/landed.PNG" style="width:60%;" alt="" /> 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <header>
                                    <h4>2. Website creation</h4>
                                </header>
                                <p>To create the website an enviroment for web development is needed. I used the text editor <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>. In Brackets I changed the HTML files for my templete of choice to suit the website for my needs. To do that I mainly used the HTML files that came with the templete and created new ones where I added or deleated sections from the old ones. For additional information I relied on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools.com/html</a> and Google.</p>
                                <header>
                                    <h4>3. Creating a repository and uploading to GitHub</h4>
                                </header>
                                <p>When I was happy with the overall look of the website the next step was to create a repository through GitHub and upload it to the repository with Git Bash. Git Bash can be downloaded <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a>.</p>
                                <p>First create a repository on GitHub:</p>
                                
                                <img src="images/repository.PNG" style="width:60%;" alt=""/>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>Next Git Bash is used to upload all of the files needed for the website to GitHub. I had trouble using the insturcions on GitHub, only "README.MD" was uploaded to my repository. Therefor, I used the following commands in Git Bash:  </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Open Git Bash and enter your user name and email: <br><code>git config --global user.name "your_username"</code><br><code>git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"</code></li>
                                    <li>Go to your website's directory by using the cd command in Git Bash or right click on "Git Bash Here" in your website's folder. </li>
                                    <li>Write the following commands:<br><code>git init</code><br><code>git add .</code><br><code>git commit -m "first commit"</code><br><code>git branch -M main</code><br><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/Valgeir99/valgeir.git</code><br><code>git push -u origin main</code></li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <img src="images/gitbash.PNG" style="width:60%;" alt=""/>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>The website is now in your repository.</p>
                                <p>Finally, to publish your website go to Settings->GitHub Pages->Source->Branch: main</p>
                                <img src="images/publish.PNG" style="width:60%;" alt=""/>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>If you want to update your repository the following commands in Git Bash are used when you are in your website's directory on your computer:<br>
                                <code>git add .</code><br><code>git commit -m "what did you change?"</code><br><code>git push"</code></p>
